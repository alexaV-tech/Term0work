A heavy, dark travel cloak hangs in an otherwise empty armoire, a stark contrast to the fineryâ€”a promise of a different life. The only exit is south, back into the heart of the house.",

The path north leads to your bedroom, the east door opens to the study, and the west passage goes to the stables. To the south, a door leads to the old gardens and a hidden shed.

Your favorite, a sturdy horse known for his stamina, is here, but his stall is securely locked.
