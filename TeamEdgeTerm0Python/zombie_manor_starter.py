A heavy, dark travel cloak hangs in an otherwise empty armoire, a stark contrast to the fineryâ€”a promise of a different life. The only exit is south, back into the heart of the house.",

Stern-faced portraits of your ancestors line the walls, their painted eyes seeming to follow your every move. This is the nexus of the estate, a dangerous, open space. The path north leads to your bedroom, the east door opens to the study, and the west passage goes to the stables. To the south, a door leads to the old gardens and a hidden shed.

Moonlight filters through the wooden slats of the walls, illuminating the gentle, shifting forms of the horses in their stalls. Your favorite, a sturdy horse known for his stamina, is here, but his stall is securely locked. By the door, hanging on a rusty nail, is a simple iron stable key, an arrogant oversight by your captors. To take the sturdy horse, you must take the key The path east leads back to the hallway.",

A quick pry reveals a hidden recess beneath it, containing a small but heavy gold pouch. The only way out is north to the hallway.",
